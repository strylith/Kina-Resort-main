# Mock API Complete Fix - Final Solution

## Problem Summary
The `/mock/bookings` endpoint was returning 404 because:
1. Mock routes were being loaded asynchronously after server started
2. Express was matching requests to 404 handler before mock routes registered
3. Server needed restart to pick up changes

## Solution Implemented

### 1. Server Route Registration (`server/server.js`)
- **Route Loading**: Mock routes now load **synchronously** in `startServer()` BEFORE `app.listen()`
- **Registration Order**:
  1. API routes (`/api/*`)
  2. Package seeding
  3. **Mock routes (`/mock/*`)** ← Loaded BEFORE server starts
  4. Server starts listening

### 2. Mock Routes Module (`server/routes/mockBookings.js`)
- ✅ `GET /mock/bookings` - Returns all bookings with items and packages
- ✅ `POST /mock/bookings` - Creates new booking (no auth)
- ✅ `GET /mock` - Health check endpoint
- ✅ Added detailed logging for debugging

### 3. Frontend API (`assets/js/utils/api.js`)
- ✅ Detects development mode (`hostname === 'localhost'`)
- ✅ `fetchUserBookings()` uses mock API when `USE_MOCK_BOOKINGS = true`
- ✅ `mockApiRequest()` helper for mock endpoints (no auth headers)

### 4. Booking Modal (`assets/js/components/bookingModal.js`)
- ✅ `saveBookingToSupabase()` detects development mode
- ✅ Uses `/mock/bookings` in development (no auth)
- ✅ Uses `/api/bookings` in production (with auth)

## Data Flow

### Development (Mock Mode):
```
Frontend (api.js)
  ↓ detect localhost
USE_MOCK_BOOKINGS = true
  ↓
mockApiRequest('/bookings')
  ↓
GET http://localhost:3000/mock/bookings
  ↓
server/routes/mockBookings.js
  ↓
mockClient.tables.bookings
  ↓
Return enriched bookings array
```

### Production (Real API):
```
Frontend (api.js)
  ↓ detect production
USE_MOCK_BOOKINGS = false
  ↓
apiRequest('/bookings') with auth token
  ↓
GET http://localhost:3000/api/bookings
  ↓
server/routes/bookings.js (with auth middleware)
  ↓
Supabase database
  ↓
Return user bookings
```

## Testing Steps

### 1. Restart Server (Critical!)
```powershell
cd server
$env:USE_MOCK_DB = "true"
npm start
```

### 2. Verify Routes Loaded
Check console for:
```
🧪 Mock API routes registered at /mock
   - GET  /mock/bookings
   - POST /mock/bookings
🚀 Kina Resort Backend API running on port 3000
🧪 Mock API endpoint: http://localhost:3000/mock
```

### 3. Test Mock Endpoint
```bash
# Should return health check
curl http://localhost:3000/mock

# Should return bookings (empty array initially)
curl http://localhost:3000/mock/bookings
```

### 4. Test Frontend
1. Refresh page → Check console
2. Should see: `Using Mock Bookings: true`
3. Navigate to "My Bookings" → Should load without 404
4. Submit a booking → Should save to mock DB
5. Check "My Bookings" again → Should show new booking

## Expected Console Output

### Server Startup:
```
🧩 Seeding default packages for mock database...
✅ Default packages seeded (9 packages)
🧪 Mock API routes registered at /mock
   - GET  /mock/bookings
   - POST /mock/bookings
🚀 Kina Resort Backend API running on port 3000
🧪 Mock API endpoint: http://localhost:3000/mock
```

### Frontend Request:
```
🌐 API Configuration:
  Using Mock Bookings: true
  MOCK_API_BASE: http://localhost:3000/mock

[MockDB] Fetching user bookings from mock API...
📡 Mock API Request: http://localhost:3000/mock/bookings
[MockBookings] GET /bookings called
[MockBookings] Found 0 bookings
[MockBookings] Returning 0 enriched bookings
```

## Files Modified

1. ✅ `server/server.js` - Route loading order fixed
2. ✅ `server/routes/mockBookings.js` - Added logging and health check
3. ✅ `assets/js/utils/api.js` - Mock API detection and routing
4. ✅ `assets/js/components/bookingModal.js` - Uses mock API in dev

## Verification Checklist

- [ ] Server restarted with `USE_MOCK_DB=true`
- [ ] Console shows "Mock API routes registered"
- [ ] `/mock/bookings` returns 200 (not 404)
- [ ] "My Bookings" page loads without errors
- [ ] Booking submission works
- [ ] New bookings appear in "My Bookings"

## Troubleshooting

### Still Getting 404?
1. **Check server logs** - Should show "Mock API routes registered"
2. **Verify USE_MOCK_DB** - Run: `echo $env:USE_MOCK_DB` (should be "true")
3. **Test endpoint directly** - `curl http://localhost:3000/mock`
4. **Check route order** - Mock routes must load BEFORE 404 handler

### Routes Not Loading?
- Ensure `server/routes/mockBookings.js` exists
- Check for syntax errors in mock routes file
- Verify `export default router;` at end of file
