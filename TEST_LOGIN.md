# Quick Fix for Login Issue

## Problem
Invalid credentials when logging in on mobile device

## Solution

### Option 1: Create a New Account
Since the test users might have password issues, it's easiest to just create a new account:

1. Go to: https://strylith.github.io/Kina-Resort-main
2. Click "Sign In" 
3. Click "Create one here" at the bottom
4. Fill in:
   - First Name: Your Name
   - Last Name: Your Last Name
   - Email: your@email.com
   - Password: (choose your own)
5. Click "Create Account"

### Option 2: Use Correct Test Credentials

If you want to use test accounts, these should work:

**Account 1:**
- Email: `john@example.com`
- Password: `customer123`

**Account 2:**
- Email: `jane@example.com`  
- Password: `customer123`

**Account 3:**
- Email: `admin@kinaresort.com`
- Password: `admin123`

### Option 3: Check Browser Console

If login still fails:

1. Open browser developer tools (F12 on desktop)
2. Go to Console tab
3. Try logging in again
4. Look for error messages
5. Check the Network tab for failed requests

### Common Issues

1. **Wrong credentials** - Make sure email and password are exactly as shown (case-sensitive)
2. **Backend not running** - Check if Railway backend is deployed
3. **CORS errors** - Should be fixed by the recent server.js update
4. **Network issues** - Check internet connection

## Verify Backend is Running

Visit: https://kina-resort-main-production.up.railway.app/health

You should see:
```json
{
  "success": true,
  "message": "Kina Resort Backend API is running",
  "timestamp": "..."
}
```

## Verify Frontend is Accessible

Visit: https://strylith.github.io/Kina-Resort-main

You should see the Kina Resort homepage.

## Still Having Issues?

1. Clear browser cache and cookies
2. Try incognito/private mode
3. Check if you're on HTTPS (not HTTP)
4. Make sure backend is deployed with latest changes

**Recommendation:** Create a fresh account using Option 1 - it's the easiest and will work for sure!
