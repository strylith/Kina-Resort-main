# Mock Routes 404 Fix

## Problem
GET `/mock/bookings` returns 404 because mock routes were loading asynchronously after server startup.

## Solution
Load mock routes **synchronously** in `startServer()` function BEFORE starting the server.

## Changes Made

### server/server.js
1. Removed async module-level route loading
2. Added synchronous route loading in `startServer()` before `app.listen()`
3. Ensures routes are registered before server accepts requests

### Route Loading Order:
1. âœ… Regular API routes (`/api/*`)
2. âœ… Package seeding (if mock DB)
3. âœ… Mock routes loading (`/mock/*`) - NEW: Before server starts
4. âœ… Server starts listening

## Verification

After restarting server, you should see:
```
ðŸ§© Seeding default packages for mock database...
âœ… Default packages seeded
ðŸ§ª Mock API routes enabled at /mock
ðŸš€ Kina Resort Backend API running on port 3000
ðŸ§ª Mock API endpoint: http://localhost:3000/mock
```

## Test Endpoint

```bash
# Should return empty array (or bookings if any exist)
curl http://localhost:3000/mock/bookings
```

Expected response:
```json
{
  "success": true,
  "data": []
}
```
