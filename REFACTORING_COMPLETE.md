# Database Refactoring - Complete

## Summary

Successfully refactored the booking database to eliminate redundancy and ensure proper integration between booking modal and calendar display.

## What Was Done

### 1. Database Migration
- **Removed redundant columns** from `bookings` table:
  - `per_room_guests` (was duplicating `booking_items` data)
  - `selected_cottages` (was duplicating `booking_items` data)
- **Result**: Single source of truth for all booking items

### 2. Backend API Updates
**File**: `server/routes/bookings.js`

**Changes Made**:
- Enhanced availability query to include per-item details (lines 29-51)
- Added package_id filter for accuracy
- Returns detailed guest information per item
- Updated comments to explain data flow

**Key Enhancement**:
```javascript
// Now queries with full item details
.select(`
  id,
  item_id,
  item_type,
  guest_name,  // Per-item guest name
  adults,      // Per-item adults
  children,    // Per-item children
  bookings!inner (
    package_id,
    check_in,
    check_out,
    status
  )
`)
```

### 3. Error Handling Improvements
**File**: `assets/js/components/calendarModal.js`

**Changes Made**:
- Enhanced error logging (lines 131-147)
- User-friendly error messages for backend connectivity
- Better debugging information

## How It Works Now

### Creating a Booking

```
User fills form with:
  - 2 rooms (A1, A2)
  - 1 cottage (Family Cottage)
  - Guest names per room
    ↓
Backend creates:
  1 booking record in `bookings`
  3 item records in `booking_items`:
    - Room A1 (guest: John, 2 adults, 1 child)
    - Room A2 (guest: Jane, 2 adults, 0 children)
    - Family Cottage (guest: John)
```

### Calendar Display

```
User opens calendar
    ↓
Query booking_items for date range
    ↓
Filter by status (pending/confirmed)
    ↓
Return for each date:
  - Room A1 (booked)
  - Room A2 (booked)
  - Room A3 (available)
  - Room A4 (available)
    ↓
Display "A1, A2" labels on booked dates
```

### My Bookings Display

```
User views bookings
    ↓
Query bookings with booking_items
    ↓
Group by item_type:
  - Rooms: A1, A2
  - Cottages: Family Cottage
    ↓
Display: "2 rooms + 1 cottage"
Detail view shows per-item guest info
```

## Benefits

1. **Single Source of Truth**: All item data in `booking_items` table only
2. **No Redundancy**: Data stored once, referenced many times
3. **Better Tracking**: Per-item guest details (not just per-booking)
4. **Easier Maintenance**: Changes in one place
5. **Improved Performance**: Less storage, simpler queries
6. **Data Integrity**: No inconsistencies between tables

## Files Modified

1. **Database** - Removed 2 redundant columns via migration
2. `server/routes/bookings.js` - Enhanced queries and comments
3. `assets/js/components/calendarModal.js` - Improved error handling

## Testing Needed

To fully test the refactored system:

1. **Create booking with multiple rooms**:
   - Select rooms A1, A2
   - Add guest details per room
   - Submit booking
   - Verify appears in My Bookings

2. **Add cottage to booking**:
   - Select Family Cottage
   - Submit booking
   - Verify appears in My Bookings

3. **Check calendar display**:
   - Open calendar
   - Verify booked rooms show labels (A1, A2)
   - Verify status shows "2 of 4 available"

4. **Verify for all users**:
   - Login as different user
   - Calendar should show same bookings
   - (not limited to booking owner)

## Current State

✅ Database refactored
✅ Backend updated
✅ Calendar error handling improved
✅ Single source of truth established
✅ Documentation created

⏳ Ready for testing with real bookings

## Next Steps

1. Start backend server: `cd server && npm start`
2. Create test bookings with multiple items
3. Verify calendar displays room labels
4. Verify My Bookings shows all items
5. Test with different users
