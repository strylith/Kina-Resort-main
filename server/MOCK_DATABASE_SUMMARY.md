# Mock Database Implementation Summary

## ✅ Completed

### Phase 1: Infrastructure Setup
- [x] Installed Jest and supertest dependencies
- [x] Created Jest configuration for ES modules
- [x] Added test scripts to package.json
- [x] Created test directory structure

### Phase 2: Database Abstraction Layer
- [x] Created `db/mockDatabaseClient.js` - in-memory mock implementation
- [x] Created `db/supabaseClient.js` - real Supabase wrapper
- [x] Created `db/databaseClient.js` - factory pattern for client selection
- [x] Mock client supports: select, insert, update, delete, eq, order, single
- [x] Mock auth client supports: createUser, deleteUser, signInWithPassword, resetPasswordForEmail

### Phase 3: Route Refactoring (Partial)
- [x] Refactored `routes/auth.js` to use `db` and `dbAuth`
- [x] Refactored `routes/packages.js` to use `db`
- [x] Refactored `routes/bookings.js` to use `db` (partial, more work needed)

### Phase 4: Test Setup
- [x] Created `__tests__/setup.js` with global test configuration
- [x] Mock database resets before each test
- [x] Environment variable support (USE_MOCK_DB)

## ⏳ Remaining Work

### Phase 3 (Continued)
- [ ] Complete bookings.js refactoring (multiple supabase.from calls remain)
- [ ] Refactor `routes/users.js`
- [ ] Refactor `routes/settings.js`
- [ ] Update `middleware/auth.js` to use new db client

### Phase 4 (Testing)
- [ ] Create test file: `__tests__/routes/auth.test.js`
- [ ] Create test file: `__tests__/routes/packages.test.js`
- [ ] Create test file: `__tests__/routes/bookings.test.js`
- [ ] Create test file: `__tests__/routes/users.test.js`
- [ ] Create test file: `__tests__/routes/settings.test.js`

### Phase 5 (Documentation & CI)
- [ ] Update `README.md` with testing instructions
- [ ] Create `.github/workflows/test.yml` for CI/CD
- [ ] Add `.env.example` with USE_MOCK_DB flag

## 🎯 How to Use

### Run Tests (Mock Database)
```bash
cd server
npm test
```

### Run with Mock DB
```bash
USE_MOCK_DB=true npm start
```

### Run with Real Supabase (Production)
```bash
npm start  # or don't set USE_MOCK_DB
```
