# Database Refactoring Summary

## Overview
Refactored the booking database structure to eliminate data redundancy and ensure proper integration between booking modal and calendar display.

## Changes Made

### 1. Removed Redundant Columns
**Table**: `bookings`

**Removed Columns**:
- `per_room_guests` (JSONB) - This data was duplicated in `booking_items`
- `selected_cottages` (JSONB) - This data was duplicated in `booking_items`

**Rationale**: 
- Data was being stored twice (once in `bookings`, once in `booking_items`)
- Led to potential inconsistencies
- Violated single source of truth principle
- Calendar was only reading from `booking_items` anyway

### 2. Data Structure (After Refactoring)

#### `bookings` Table (Parent Record)
```sql
- id (PK)
- user_id (FK to users)
- package_id (FK to packages)
- check_in, check_out (dates)
- guests (JSONB) - Total guest summary only
- status (pending/confirmed/cancelled/completed)
- total_cost, payment_mode
- contact_number, special_requests
- created_at, updated_at
```

**What it stores**: High-level booking information only

#### `booking_items` Table (Individual Items)
```sql
- id (PK)
- booking_id (FK to bookings)
- item_type (room/cottage/function-hall)
- item_id (e.g., "Room A1", "Family Cottage")
- guest_name (per-item guest details)
- adults, children (per-item counts)
- price_per_unit
- created_at
```

**What it stores**: All individual items with detailed per-item information

### 3. Updated API Query

**File**: `server/routes/bookings.js` (lines 29-51)

**Changes**:
- Enhanced query to join booking_items with bookings
- Added package_id filter for accuracy
- Returns detailed item information including guest names per item
- All data now comes from single source: `booking_items`

**Before**:
```javascript
// Had redundant columns in bookings
bookings.per_room_guests, bookings.selected_cottages
```

**After**:
```javascript
// Single source of truth
booking_items with all item details joined to bookings
```

## Data Flow

### Creating a Booking

```
User submits form
  ↓
Backend creates booking record in `bookings`
  ↓
For each room/cottage:
  ↓
  Create record in `booking_items` with item details
  ↓
All data stored once in booking_items
```

### Displaying in Calendar

```
Calendar requests availability
  ↓
Query booking_items joined with bookings
  ↓
Filter by status (pending/confirmed)
  ↓
Return item details per date:
  - item_id (Room A1, A2, etc.)
  - guest_name per item
  - adults/children per item
```

### Displaying in My Bookings

```
User views bookings
  ↓
Query bookings with booking_items
  ↓
Group items by item_type
  ↓
Display summary:
  - 2 rooms + 1 cottage
  - Show detail view with per-item guest info
```

## Benefits

1. **No Data Redundancy**: Items stored once in `booking_items`
2. **Single Source of Truth**: Calendar, My Bookings, and APIs all read from same table
3. **Easier Maintenance**: Changes only needed in one place
4. **Better Performance**: Less storage, simpler queries
5. **More Granular**: Can track guest details per item (not just per booking)

## Migration Details

**Migration Name**: `refactor_booking_structure_remove_redundant_fields`

**SQL**:
```sql
ALTER TABLE bookings 
DROP COLUMN IF EXISTS per_room_guests,
DROP COLUMN IF EXISTS selected_cottages;
```

**Status**: Applied successfully

## Testing Checklist

- [x] Removed redundant columns
- [x] Updated backend queries
- [x] Verified booking_items is single source of truth
- [ ] Test creating booking with multiple rooms
- [ ] Test creating booking with cottages
- [ ] Verify calendar displays booked items correctly
- [ ] Verify My Bookings shows all items correctly
- [ ] Test per-item guest details

## Example: Booking with Multiple Items

**Before Refactoring**:
```json
bookings: {
  "id": 1,
  "per_room_guests": [{"roomId": "A1", "guestName": "John", ...}], // Duplicate
  "selected_cottages": ["Family Cottage"], // Duplicate
  ...
}
booking_items: [
  {"item_id": "Room A1", "guest_name": "John", ...}, // Also here
  {"item_id": "Family Cottage", ...} // Also here
]
```

**After Refactoring**:
```json
bookings: {
  "id": 1,
  "guests": {"adults": 4, "children": 1}, // Summary only
  ...
}
booking_items: [
  {"item_id": "Room A1", "guest_name": "John", "adults": 2, "children": 0},
  {"item_id": "Room A2", "guest_name": "Jane", "adults": 2, "children": 1},
  {"item_id": "Family Cottage", "guest_name": "John", ...}
]
```

## Verification

### Current Database Structure

**bookings table columns** (after refactoring):
1. id
2. user_id
3. package_id
4. check_in
5. check_out
6. guests (JSONB - total summary only)
7. status
8. created_at
9. updated_at
10. total_cost
11. payment_mode
12. contact_number
13. special_requests

**booking_items table columns** (single source of truth):
1. id
2. booking_id
3. item_type (room/cottage/function-hall)
4. item_id (e.g., "Room A1")
5. guest_name
6. adults
7. children
8. price_per_unit
9. created_at

### Key Changes Summary

✅ Removed redundant `per_room_guests` column
✅ Removed redundant `selected_cottages` column
✅ All item details now stored in `booking_items` only
✅ Updated API queries to read from `booking_items`
✅ Enhanced query to include per-item guest details
✅ Added package_id filter for accuracy

## Notes

- All existing functionality preserved
- Calendar already reads from booking_items correctly
- My Bookings already displays booking_items correctly
- No breaking changes to API responses
- Migration is backward compatible (drops columns that aren't critical)
- Single source of truth eliminates data inconsistency issues
