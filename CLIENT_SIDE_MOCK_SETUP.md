# Client-Side Only Setup (No Backend Needed!)

Since you're using mock data, we can make this work entirely in the browser using localStorage.

## Quick Setup Option

I can refactor the app to work completely client-side. Here's what would change:

### What Gets Changed:
1. **Storage**: Replace mock API with `localStorage` for bookings
2. **Auth**: Use `localStorage` for user sessions
3. **Packages**: Already static, no changes needed
4. **API Calls**: Replace all mock API calls with localStorage operations

### Benefits:
✅ Works on GitHub Pages immediately  
✅ No CORS issues  
✅ No backend costs  
✅ Fast and simple  

### What I'll Create:
1. New file: `assets/js/utils/localStorage.js` - Handles all storage operations
2. Modified: `assets/js/utils/api.js` - Use localStorage when in production
3. Modified: `assets/js/utils/auth.js` - localStorage-based auth

This will make your site a **true static site** that works anywhere!

**Would you like me to implement this client-side solution?**

If yes, the app will work perfectly on GitHub Pages without needing any backend service.
